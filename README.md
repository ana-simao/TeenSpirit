# TeenSpirit

Hackathon project developed in 24 hours (1st place)

Teen Spirit is an anti-social network made particularly for all those who feel out of place and for whom regular social networks don't seem to make sense. Against the so called "perfection", this platform is a space for the real and ugly.

Technologies: Java, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Spring MVC, Maven.

Creators Filipa Monteiro, Miguel Félix, Gonçalo Pereira dos Santos, Ana Antunes Simão
